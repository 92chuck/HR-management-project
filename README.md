### Notes: 

Please name files and variables with sematic names so it would be easier to track.

For Angular structure: 
- /components will contain all components that are parts of one or multiple pages.
- /pages will contain all components that are representing a whole page route.
- I have already included bootstrap into the main html.

For backend: 
- I have installed: bcrypts, cors, dotenv, express, jsonwebtoken, and mongoose.
